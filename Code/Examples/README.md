# Examples

Here are three examples on how to (1) load and visualize the data, (2) run PPI, and (3) perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the policy priorities. Each file was prepared in a jupyter notebook. By downloading the file with extension `ipynb` and opening it witht the jupyter app includded in the Anaconda python distribution, you should be able to run the example.

The folder contrains no only the examples, but the necessary code and data. Therefore, by downloading the entire folder, the examples should be able to run off the shelf.
